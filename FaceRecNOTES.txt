FaceRecognition.py

https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py

Operates faster than other example because. (this is from pages official github)
#   1. Process each video frame at 1/4 resolution (though still display it at full resolution)
#   2. Only detect faces in every other frame of video.



# PLEASE NOTE: This example requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read from your webcam.
# OpenCV is *not* required to use the face_recognition library. It's only required if you want to run this
# specific demo. If you have trouble installing it, try any of the other demos that don't require it instead.
